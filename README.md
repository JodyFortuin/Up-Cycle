# Up-Cycle 2020 - http://upcycle101.herokuapp.com/

A group Hackathon project used to assist people who would like to recycle their materials which shows an estimated value and mapped locations of recycling firms. It was built using NodeJS express with an SQL database.

Challenge
It solved a problem of littering in the community. It also helped less fortunate people to earn an income or for business to have a way to contribute to a positive environmental impact.

Target Demographic
The demographic for Up-Cycle was people or businesses with recyclable materials who have the intention of earning an extra income or decreasing their carbon footprint.

Project Focus
My focus for the project was the backend functionality such as the material form which calculated the estimated value of materials.
